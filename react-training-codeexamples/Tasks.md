# Tasks

## JSX / TSX
1. Create a Book-Component which displays the author's name, title of the book and it's release date
2. Render the component in App.tsx

## Conditional Rendering
Render a list of Books. A book object should contain a property that says whether it is available or not. If not, render a label telling the user its currently unavailable

## Hooks and Databinding
### useState - hook
You're already rendering a list of books in your app. 
Use Material UI's slider (https://mui.com/material-ui/react-slider/) and the useState hook to determine how many books should be displayed in your list. The slider should provide as many options as the length of your list. Render the amount of books dependent on the user's choice.
